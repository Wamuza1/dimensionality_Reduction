# dimensionality_Reduction

# Project Overview

Many ML problems involves thousabds or more than that features for each trainaing instance. These features make training slow and make harder to find a good solution. It helps to speed up training process and also useful for data viz. it make it easy and plot a condensed view of a high dimensional traing set on a graph and provide us insightful visualization.

# Purpose

In this project we will examin the three popular dimensionality reduction algorithms.
- PCA
- Kernel PCA
- LDA

PCA
